### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a process-oriented data analyst that loves visualizing and cleaning data in Jupyter. I work to continuously improve my coding and you'll see it in my projects. By reading and keeping up to date on the latest techniques I am able to make my code easier to refrence and debug. I am currently working on my portfolio so stay tuned for more.
